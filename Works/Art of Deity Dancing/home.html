        <h3 class="div-header">Each Theyyam is Different</h3>
        <p class="post-text divh1">Theyyam artists perform without a break for 20-24 hours. The facial make up, costumes and names of the Theyyam can differ evenon the two banks of a river. Once the make up is done and adornments worn, there is a moment when the Theyyam looks at his own reflection in a mirror and starts tremble. That moment completes his transformation.</p>
        <p class="post-text divh1">A Theyyam artiste undergoes rigorous training and days or weeks of pious abstinence to feel divine possession before a performance. The rich palette of colours and the variety of adornments ensure that a Theyyam's mere presence is overwhelming. People address their prayers and concerns to the Theyyam even today, and find solace through their interactions with these godlike mortals.</p>
        <p class="post-text divh1">One of such variations of Theyyam is Theccamundi variations. In this form,the Theyyam runs and jumps onto pile of embers called meleri. The ritual is also known as Agnipravesham.</p>
        <h3 class="div-header1">Above Caste Hierarchy</h3>
        <p class="post-text divh2">Theyyam are usually men from around 15 backward caste communities. Most are from the Vannaan and Malayan communities. There is a social aspect to this because a labourer who obeys his employer most days of the year gets elevated into a devine figure as a Theyyam. That day, even his employer bows before him in reverence and listens to his commands and directions.</p>
        <h3 class="div-header">Codified 5 centuries ago</h3>
        <p class="post-text divh1">Theyyam is almost as old as the Dravidian civilization, but it was practiced among the working classes to seek rain, a good harvest etc.Theyyam season starts from the 10 th day of Malayalam month of Thulam. It generally begins by the end of the  month of October and ends in late May or early June with specific performances.</p>
        <h3 class="div-header">Lone Goddess among Gods</h3>
        <p class="post-text divh1">In Theyyam, beings other than gods and goddesses are also worshipped. There's Puli(leopard) Theyyam, Muthala(crocodile)Theyyam, a Theyyam for serpents etc., also there are Theyyams connected to ancestral/ghost worship in families as well as performances which began due to astrological recommendations.</p>
        <p class="post-text divh1">The Only Temple where Theyyam is performed by woman is in Devakkoothu. Ambujakshi Amma is the lone woman Theyyam performer today.</p>
